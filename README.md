# Glaucoma-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Feynn_Labs_Project-3
**Abstract:**
Glaucoma is a major global cause of blindness. As the symptoms of glaucoma appear, when the
disease reaches an advanced stage, proper screening of glaucoma in the early stages is challenging.
Therefore, regular glaucoma screening is essential and recommended. However, eye screening is
currently subjective, time-consuming and labour-intensive and there are insufficient eye specialists
available. We present an automatic two-stage glaucoma screening system to reduce the workload of
ophthalmologists. This report presents a detailed market segmentation analysis for glaucoma disease
prediction, incorporating findings from multiple sources, and explores the business opportunities and
technical requirements for developing a prediction system.
**Problem Statement**
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy causing irreversible vision loss if undiagnosed. Early
detection remains a challenge due to its asymptomatic nature in initial stages. Glaucoma is a leading
cause of blindness worldwide, with no early symptoms, making early detection challenging yet vital.
Traditional methods of glaucoma detection involve manual assessment by ophthalmologists, which
can be time-consuming and subjective. There is a need for an automated, accurate, and efficient
system to assist in the early detection of glaucoma using readily available digital fundus images.
**Business Opportunity**
Creating a business centred on glaucoma presents diverse opportunities in healthcare innovation and
service delivery. Developing AI-driven diagnostic solutions tailored for early detection through retinal
imaging analysis can revolutionise how glaucoma is diagnosed, offering accuracy and efficiency.
Additionally, establishing teleophthalmology services enables remote consultations and monitoring,
enhancing accessibility to specialised care, especially in underserved areas. Investing in research and
development for novel medications, therapies, and surgical techniques aimed at managing intraocular
pressure and preventing vision loss represents another key area.
Educational initiatives and digital health platforms can play a crucial role in raising awareness about
glaucoma prevention and treatment options, empowering patients and healthcare providers alike.
Expanding into emerging markets with growing healthcare needs and forming strategic partnerships
with healthcare providers, research institutions, and government bodies can foster global reach and
impact.
Navigating regulatory landscapes and providing compliance consulting services for new diagnostic
and treatment technologies are critical for ensuring adherence to industry standards and accelerating
market entry. By focusing on these opportunities, businesses can not only drive innovation in
glaucoma care but also make significant strides in improving patient outcomes and quality of life
worldwide.

**Final Product Prototype**
GlaucoDetect AI represents a breakthrough in glaucoma detection technology, integrating advanced
machine learning models to analyse retinal images with exceptional accuracy. Designed for precision
and accessibility, GlaucoDetect AI features a compact and user-friendly portable device suitable for
use in various healthcare settings.
Key components of GlaucoDetect AI include a robust Flask API backend hosting the AI model,
